Welcome to the real world: An open world game where players can participate in various activities in an online virtual society.

## In Game Features

### Education and Collage
  Players can enroll into an in-game college where they can study to gain credentials (a diploma) for a specific job title, allowing access to higher paying jobs within the game. The college consists of a number of subjects, each allowing access to certain types of jobs in the society that require a diploma in that subject. To enroll into the college under a certain subject, a player must physically enter the collage, and speak with the designated NPC at the front desk. The Player can optionally view information on the different subjects and the oportunities which they provide. They can then decide to enroll, where they can then select the class/subject they would like to enroll in, and fill out an application form.
  
Each class has a specific amount of "study hours" that the player must spend being in the classroom of that class inside the college. The player can attend class whenever and however long they desire in intervals, however wont be granted the diploma for that class unless they eventually complete the required study hours for that class. Within these classrooms the player will find textbooks corresponding to the associated subject, which they can read. Once the required amount of study hours is completed the player will be required to take a test with questions related to subjects found in the textbooks. If the player passes the test, they will be granted a diploma. Otherwise, they will have to redo the study hours and retake the test. The amount of study hours needed and the amount of questions on the final test vary depending on the subject. Below is a list of all college classes, their corresponding job oportunities and their study hours.

### Jobs and Employment

### Currency and Banking
  The in-game society runs on a currency (dollars) which each player is designated a certain amount of (5000) at conception. Each player has the ability to sell objects to other players through a personal store, in which they can display some of their belongings to be viewed and bought by other players. Players can also earn money by applying to a job and complying with it's nesessary requirments. Players by default have no bank account, and must go to the bank and speak with the designated NPSs at the front desk. The player will have to fill out an application form, after which they will have a designated bank account and the corresponding documentation such as the PIN number for the account and a debit card. Players can manage their money by going to the bank and speaking with the designated NPSs at the front desk or accessing the bank ATMs. At these points the player will have to provide their PIN number, which can be found in the player's documentation. They can then preform actions with their account which are listed below.
  
  - Withdraws
  - Deposits
  - Transfers
  - PIN changes

PIN changes are required in the case that another player steals the PIN number of another by snooping their banking documentation. For deposits and withdraws the player will be prompted with the amount of money to be deposited or withdrawed from the account. For transfers the player will be prompted with the name of the player they want to transfer the money to. Players with money in bank accounts are vulnerable to having funds stolen through identity theft if another player gains their PIN by snooping their documentation, in which case that player would have to change their PIN number. Players with physical money on their person are vulnerable to pick-pocketing, and loosing whatever amount of money was on them when they are killed. Its recommended to have all money in your bank account, only withdrawing money to pay at establishments which dont accept card as payment.
  
### Crime and Legislation
  The in-game society runs by reasonable rules or "laws". If broken the player will face realistic penalties based on the law broken.

A list of all societal laws and their circumstances are below.

Crime in the society is managed using a report system. Special reports called "crime reports" can be submitted if the game detects a law break, and can also be created by players by going to the police station and creating a crime report. The game will acknowledge and document these crimes, however no action will be taken on them by the game itself. These reports are listed in the crime database stored at the police station, and will be distributed among officers so that they can take action on the crimes. At the time of being arrested an offending player will be prompted with the option to plead "innocent" or "guilty". If the player pleads as guilty they will then have the option of paying the corresponding fine or serving time in jail. If the player pleads "innocent" they will then be subject to a court trial.
