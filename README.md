### Crime and Legislation
  The in-game society runs by reasonable rules or "laws". If broken the player will face realistic penalties based on the law broken. These laws are enforced by the server and players employeed in law enforcement, and ensure that the in-game society maintains a civil state. A list of all societal laws and their circumstances are below.
  
1. **No Excessive public profanity**. This law prohibits excessive profanity in game through the public chat. If a player exceeds a certain threshold of cursing or expressing profane language within the chat, this will be detected by the server and an appropiate bounty will be set on the offending player. This law dose not apply to private chats between players through the messaging app on the player's phone. Specifically this law is broken when a player uses flagged language detectable by the server on 10 separate ocasions.

Crime in the society is managed using a report system. Special reports called "crime reports" can be submitted if the game detects a law break, and can also be created by players by going to the police station and creating a crime report. The game will acknowledge and document these crimes, however no action will be taken on them by the game itself. These reports are listed in the crime database stored at the police station, and will be distributed among officers so that they can take action on the crimes. This is managed by having officers access the computer on their designated desk, and opening the crime database. Within the database they will have a portion of reports assigned to them, which they must take action on and then mark as solved. Each of these crime reports or "bounties", have a specific amount of money associated to them depending on the type of crime. Once completed, the money associated with the specific report is deposited into the officer's account. If reports are falsly marked as solved, it will be considered a violation of *law 13* and the officer will be penalized. Policing is the highest paying job due to its importance within the society.
