## In Game Features

### Education and Collage

  Players can enroll into an in-game college where they can study to gain credentials (a diploma) for a specific job title, allowing access to higher paying jobs within the game. The college consists of a number of subjects, each allowing access to certain types of jobs in the society that require a diploma in that subject. To enroll into the college under a certain subject, a player must physically enter the collage, and speak with the designated NPC at the front desk. The Player can optionally view information on the different subjects and the oportunities which they provide. They can then decide to enroll, where they can then select the class/subject they would like to enroll in, and fill out an application form.
  
Each class has a specific amount of "study hours" that the player must spend being in the classroom of that class inside the college. The player can attend class whenever and however long they desire in intervals, however wont be granted the diploma for that class unless they eventually complete the required study hours for that class. Within these classrooms the player will find textbooks corresponding to the associated subject, which they can read. Once the required amount of study hours is completed the player will be required to take a test with questions related to subjects found in the textbooks. If the player passes the test, they will be granted a diploma. Otherwise, they will have to redo the study hours and retake the test. The amount of study hours needed and the amount of questions on the final test vary depending on the subject and classes with higher study hours will grant more valuble diplomas, allowing access to higher paying jobs. Below is a list of all college classes, and their study hours.

1. English - (15 hours)
3. Social Studies - (25 hours)
4. Science - (40 hours)
5. Math - (62 hours)
6. Technology - (70 hours)

### Jobs and Employment

  Player's have the ability to earn money, the primary way of doing this is by applying to a job. Within a player's phone they can find a job listing application. By opening this app the player will have a list of all avaliable jobs in the city, their locations, their worker requirements, job description, salary and their required credentials, such as a diploma or driver's license. The player can then apply to any of the jobs listed in the app by going to it's building and speaking with the designated NPC at the front desk. There the player can request to apply for the job and submit their CV. 
  
The player's CV (or resume) is a document which must be submitted any time they apply for a job. A player must edit their CV before applying to any job, such that it describes them as a worker closely matching the "worker requirements" section of the corresponding job listing in the job listing app. Specifically, if the player's CV contains enough keywords found in the "worker requirements" section of the job listing they're applying to, the CV will be accepted and the player will be hired. If not enough keywords are found, the player's CV will be rejected, and they'll have to edit the CV again and resubmit it in order to have another chance. A player's CV can also be rejected if it dosen't meet a minimum word count. The keywords and word count needed for the player's CV to be accepted varies depending on the job. 

Once a player is hired, the will receive a "contract", which will contain information the player needs to know about the job. The information within the contract will vary depending on the job, but all will contain the same information. The relevant information within a contract is listed below.

- Salary 
- Daily work hours
- Minimum tasks 

The "daily work hours" is the minimum amount of in-game hours the player must spend in their place of work per day in order to stay employeed. If the player misses 24 work hours after any given period of time, they will be terminated. Players will received their respective salary (specified in the contract) everyday after completing their work hours, however the precentage they receive of their salary once the work hours are completed depends on the amount of tasks they do that day compared to the job's "minimum tasks". Each job has a minimum amount of tasks per day, which specifies the minimum amount of times the player must complete their task (specified in the job description) in order to receive their full salary for that day. If the "minimum tasks" isn't met on a given day, the player's pay will decrease based on the percentage of the minimum tasks they completed. Players can work multiple jobs at the same time, having up to three jobs maximum. If a player quits a particular job they can reapply to that same job on a separate ocasion. However if a player is involuntary terminated from a job, they will be rejected if they attempt to reapply.

### Currency and Banking
  The in-game society runs on a currency (dollars) which each player is designated a certain amount of (5000) at conception. Each player has the ability to sell objects to other players through a personal store, in which they can display some of their belongings to be viewed and bought by other players. Players can also earn money by applying to a job and complying with it's nesessary requirments. 
  
Players by default have no bank account, and must go to the bank and speak with the designated NPSs at the front desk. The player will have to fill out an application form, after which they will have a designated bank account and the corresponding documentation such as the PIN number for the account and a debit card. Players can manage their money by going to the bank and speaking with the designated NPSs at the front desk or accessing the bank ATMs. At these points the player will have to provide their PIN number, which can be found in the player's documentation. They can then preform actions with their account which are listed below.
  
  - Withdraws
  - Deposits
  - Transfers
  - PIN changes

PIN changes are required in the case that another player steals the PIN number of another by snooping their banking documentation. For deposits and withdraws the player will be prompted with the amount of money to be deposited or withdrawed from the account. For transfers the player will be prompted with the name of the player they want to transfer the money to. Players with money in bank accounts are vulnerable to having funds stolen through identity theft if another player gains their PIN by snooping their documentation, in which case that player would have to change their PIN number. Players with physical money on their person are vulnerable to pick-pocketing, and loosing whatever amount of money was on them when they are killed. Its recommended to have all money in your bank account, only withdrawing money to pay at establishments which dont accept card as payment.
  
### Crime and Legislation
  The in-game society runs by reasonable rules or "laws". If broken the player will face realistic penalties based on the law broken. These laws are enforced by the server and players employeed in law enforcement, and ensure that the in-game society maintains a civil state. A list of all societal laws and their circumstances are below.
  
1. **No Excessive public profanity**. This law prohibits excessive profanity in game through the public chat. If a player exceeds a certain threshold of cursing or expressing profane language within the chat, this will be detected by the server and an appropiate crime report will be set on the offending player.

Specifically this law is broken when a player uses flagged language detectable by the server on 10 separate ocasions. 

2. **No theft**. This law prohibits that a player commits theft against another player or a mechanism of the game. This includes acts such as robbing a player of physical belongings, money and property such as a vehicle. This also includes acts such as stealing from the cash register at a store or public place.

3. **No selling or use of illegal drugs by an unauthorized civillian**. This law prohibits a player from using drugs not authorized for public use. This includes the use of the three illegal drugs within the game: *MIJ-10*, *HVI-66* and *MOZ-9*. Each of these drugs can be used legally by authorized players with the correct credentials. Otherwise, selling or use of these drugs will be detected by the server, and an appropiate crime report will be set on the offending player. Specifically this law is broken when the server detects a player using one of these illegal drugs.

4. **No tresspassing**. This law prohibits players from trespassing in restricted areas or public property, or on the private property of another player.

10. **No identity theft**. This law prohibits players from impersonating for personal gain. This specifically includes withdrawing money from another player's account through a the bank ATM's using their PIN number, which they might acquire by snooping at another player's documentation.

This specifically includes doing things like accepting bribes from other players in return for deleting their bounty from the crime database. This crime isn't detected by the server, and a crime report must be filed by a witness in order for the appropiate bounty to be placed against the offending officer.

12. **No false crime reporting**. This law prohibits a player from filing a false crime report against another player who's done nothing wrong. This will be detected by the server and the appropiate bounty will be set on the offending player.

13. **No battery or physical harm**. This law prohibits a player from attacking another player without justification. This specifically refers to when a player harms another player in any way, while the player being harmed previously didn't harm the other player. This isn't detected by the server and a crime report must be filed in order for a bounty to be set on the offending player. This law dosen't apply to self defence.

14. **No error of law**. This law specifically prohibits judges from making unfair decisions in a court of law based on the circumstances of a trial. This may include situations such as if a judge were to accept bribes from players, or encarcerates a player who is truly innocent. This will be detected by the server and the appropiate bounty will be sent on the offending player.
 
15. **No murder**. This law prohibits players from killing other players without justification. This will be detected by the server and the appropiate bounty will be set on the offending player. This law dosen't apply to self defense.
  
In the event that any of these laws are broken by a player, a "crime report" will be created either by the server, or by another player. Crime reports describe the crime committed and the player who commited them, and are sent to the "crime database" at the police station so that the reports can be processed by law enforcment. The game itself dosen't take action on crimes, but rather documents them through the mechanism of crime reports. Crime reports are stored in the crime database at the police station, where they will be distributed among players in law enforcment for them to take action on the crime. Once arrested by a player in law enforcment, an offending player will be prompted with the acusation against them, and the option plead either "innocent" or "guilty". 

If the player pleads "guilty" they will be sent to a jail cell, and will then have the option to pay a fine, or serve time in jail. If the fine is paid, the player is immediatley released and all charges are dropped, otherwise if they aren't able to pay the fine they must serve half the maximum jail time for the crime commited. However if the player pleads "guilty" they're sent to court where they'll be sentenced by a judge. If the player is truly innocent (in the case that a false crime report was filed against the player) the game will declare the player as innocent and immediately release them and drop all charges. If guilty the player will be prompted with the option to pay the fine, or serve a randomly generated amount of jail time between 0 and the maximum jail time for the crime. All crimes and their maximum penalties are listed below.
